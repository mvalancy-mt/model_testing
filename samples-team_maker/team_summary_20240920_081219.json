                "Name": "Zephyrine \"Zeph\" Wilder",
                "Backstory": "Zeph grew up in a family of nomadic tinkerers, traveling from city to city as her parents repaired and upgraded the gadgets that kept their lives on the move. She learned to dismantle and rebuild devices with ease, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon an underground hacking community that she discovered her true passion: uncovering hidden vulnerabilities and protecting the innocent from digital exploitation. After a stint as a freelance security consultant, Zeph was recruited by our team for her exceptional skills in finding creative solutions to complex problems.",
                "Appearance": "Zeph has short, spiky hair that's always adorned with tiny, colorful trinkets she collects from her travels. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of green, a trait she inherited from her mother, who claimed it was a sign of good luck. She favors functional clothing with plenty of pockets for her various gadgets and tools, which often get tangled in the frayed threads of her worn jeans.",
                "Abilities": "Zeph's true strength lies in her ability to think outside the box \u2013 or in this case, the device. She has an uncanny knack for finding obscure exploits and vulnerabilities that others might overlook. Her expertise in reverse engineering allows her to deconstruct complex systems, understanding how they tick and where the weaknesses lie. When collaborating with the team, Zeph brings a spark of creativity to even the most mundane discussions, often suggesting novel approaches that catch everyone off guard."
