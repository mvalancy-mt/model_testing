                "Name": "Kaelin \"Kae\" Thompson",
                "Backstory": "Kae grew up in a small, rural village on the banks of a polluted river. As a child, she'd watch her mother collect water from the river's edge, filtering it through layers of cloth to make it safe for drinking. When Kae was old enough, she took over this task, but soon realized that even with her mother's techniques, the water still contained hidden contaminants. This sparked a curiosity in Kae about the science behind water purification and the impact of human activities on aquatic ecosystems. She spent years studying environmental engineering and ecology, working with local communities to develop innovative solutions for clean water access.",
                "Appearance": "Kae has unruly, curly brown hair tied back in a ponytail and a smattering of freckles across her cheeks. Her eyes are an bright shade of blue that seem to hold a perpetual hint of mischief. She favors functional clothing made from durable fabrics, often paired with worn-out sneakers that have seen their fair share of muddy riverbanks.",
                "Abilities": "Kae brings a unique combination of technical expertise and community-driven empathy to the team. As a Water Specialist, she excels at designing and implementing sustainable filtration systems tailored to the specific needs of rural communities. Her hands-on experience has taught her how to communicate complex concepts in simple terms, making her an invaluable asset for collaborating with local residents and stakeholders. Kae's passion for environmental justice also drives her to seek out innovative materials and techniques that can make clean water more accessible and affordable for those who need it most."
