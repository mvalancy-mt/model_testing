                "Example Task": "For example, you may be tasked with designing a voice assistant interface for a low-literacy user who wants to set an alarm for 7am. The user's current device has limited text-to-speech feedback, making it difficult for them to understand how to use the feature. Your task would be to design an accessible interface that provides clear audio feedback and simplifies the menu structure to make it easy for the user to set their alarm.\n\nIn this scenario, you might:\n\n1. Conduct user research to understand the user's pain points and needs when setting alarms.\n2. Design a prototype of the voice assistant interface with simplified menu structures and clear audio feedback.\n3. Test the prototype with low-literacy users to gather feedback and iterate on your design.\n4. Collaborate with the development team to ensure that the designed interface is feasible to implement and meets technical requirements.\n\nThrough this process, you would create a user-centered design solution that addresses the specific needs of low-literacy users and improves their overall experience when using voice assistants."
